# Excercise

1. load `digits` function and perform classification on them
   * logistic regression
   * linear classifier
  
  use clustering with ~30/40 `n_clusters`

2. Add a `KNeighborClassifer` and feed the `dbscan` components to it. then add data incrementally and see the KNN clustering in action
