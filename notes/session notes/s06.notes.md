# Homework

classify with `DecisionTree` and `SGDClassifier` then rotate by multiplying in a matrix

```python
from sklearn.datasets import make_*
#make_blobs(n, centers, ...)
#make_moons
#Create 2 centers with 200 samples (X,Y)
```

Rotation matrix:

```matlab
|cos(a) -sin(a)|
|sin(a)  cos(a)|
```
